# [MYce Cream](https://myce-cream.herokuapp.com/)

## Overview
MYce Cream is an app that allows users to input and track the flavors of ice cream they have already tried and those they would like to try. Users can add new flavors of ice cream as well as what retailer sales that flavor.

## How to Use

### Navigation
The various functions and views of the app can be navigated using the buttons and form fields in the sidebar.

### App Flow
1. Once a flavor is added, it will be available in their "Need to Buy" view.
2. After a user buys a flavor that they had added to their list, they can click the "Got it" button next to the flavor and it will be added to their "Personal Stock" view.
3. When the user finally tastes the flavor of ice cream they have in their freezer, they will click the "Tasted!" button associated with the flavor and it will be archived.
4. The user can review all of the flavors they have tried in their "Tasted" view. Each tasted flavor has the following information:

* Flavor Name
* Retailer (if available)
* Date Tasted
* Rating

## Issues
* Need to add user authentication so that users only have access to their flavors.
* Need to add rating feature.
